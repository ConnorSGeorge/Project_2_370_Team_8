# BeeWare Example Program Breakdown

This document explains the structure and functionality of the BeeWare example program.

## Project Structure
- `helloworld/` - Main package directory
  - `src/helloworld/` - Source code
    - `__main__.py` - Entry point for running the app as a module
    - `app.py` - Main application logic
    - `__init__.py` - Package initializer
    - `resources/` - Resource files (e.g., icons, data)
  - `tests/` - Test files
  - `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration and dependencies

## How It Works
- The app is a minimal BeeWare application, typically showing a window with a greeting (e.g., "Hello, World!").
- `app.py` defines the main application class, usually subclassing BeeWare's `App` class.
- `__main__.py` allows the app to be run with `python -m helloworld`.
- Resources and configuration files support the app's appearance and packaging.

## Running the App
- When run, the app creates a native window using BeeWare's Toga library.
- The window displays a simple message or UI, demonstrating cross-platform GUI capabilities.

## Testing
- The `tests/` directory contains test scripts to verify app functionality.
- There are no tests for this simple app, but if any tests were required they would be placed here.

## Customization
- You can modify `app.py` to change the app's behavior or UI.
- Add resources to the `resources/` folder as needed.
