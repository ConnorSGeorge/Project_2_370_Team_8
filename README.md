This is Team 8's Project 2 for CS370. We were tasked with understanding the cross-platform framework called BeeWare.

A basic application is included in this project, along with:
- An INSTALLATION.md file explaining how to run the app
- A BEEWARE_PROS_AND_CONS.md file describing BeeWare's position in the field
- An APP_EXPLANATION.md file explain the folders and files of the app
- A PROGRAM_BREAKDOWN.md file explaining what the basic BeeWare app does
